## Sticking Points & What I learned

this Keyword

- Understanding that 'this' is refering to the calling object and it provides access to its properties was a good learning point.

getters & setters

- I also found the use of getters & setters to be particularly interesting. Using them as a way to both get data and set data made good sense after going throught the lectures.
